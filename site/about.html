            <h2>Project Inspiration</h2>
            <p>The inspiration behind this project stems from a personal journey and the challenges faced by those around us. Growing up in Africa, the stigma around mental health has always been profound. Many individuals suffer in silence, believing that discussing their mental health issues is not culturally acceptable. This project was born out of a desire to change that narrative and provide a platform for people to take control of their mental well-being.</p>
            <p>The journey began when I, Job nayere, witnessed a close friend's struggle with mental health issues. The lack of accessible mental health resources and the prevailing stigma made it difficult for them to seek help. This experience ignited a passion within me to create a tool that could bridge the gap and offer support to those in need.</p>
            <p>This project is also a Portfolio Project for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/" target="_blank">Holberton School</a>. As part of our curriculum, we are encouraged to develop practical solutions to real-world problems, and this web application is a testament to that mission.</p>
